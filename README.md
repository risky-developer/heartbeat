# Heartbeat
Web audio sequencer which plans to grow up.

Built for work in new browsers, supporting *Grid Layout* and actual EcmaScript standard features (including modules work without bundlers).  
Heartbeat created as Progressive Web Application so it's little bit more than web page.

### How it works
Use Numpad part of your keyboard or just click buttons
 
1. Tap **Enter** button to run sequence record
2. There are sound play bind to **number buttons**. So tap number buttons to add sound to sequence
3. Tap Enter to stop record
4. Tap **,** (comma button) to replay sequence. Also when sequence is replaying you can add new sounds to this one
5. Tap **+** (plus button) to add sequence in schedule

After you build the whole schedule you can also replay it by tap **,** (comma button).
